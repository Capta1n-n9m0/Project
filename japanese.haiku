Matsuo Basho (1644-1694)
Autumn moonlight –
a worm digs silently
into the chestnut.
Matsuo Basho (1644-1694)
Old pond
a frog jumps
the sound of water
Kobayashi Issa (1763-1828)
Autumn wind –
mountain’s shadow
wavers.
Kobayashi Issa (1763-1828)
Don’t weep, insects –
Lovers, stars themselves,
Must part
Masaoka Shiki (1867-1902)
In the coolness
of the empty sixth-month sky...
the cuckoo’s cry.
Masaoka Shiki (1867-1902)
the tree cut,
dawn breaks early
at my little window
